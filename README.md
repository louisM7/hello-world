When I find myself in times of troubles, mother Mary comes to me, speaking words of widsom : let it be
And I my hours of darkness, she's standing right in front of me, speaking words of wisdom :  let it be
And when the broken-hearted people living in the world agree, there wil be an answer :  let it be
For though they may be parted,  there is still a chance that they will see, there will be  an answer :  let it be
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me, shine on until tomorrow : let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, mother Mary comes to me, speaking words of wisdom : let it be
